      <h1><center>-FOR FUN-<center></h1><br>
<h2><center>-ART-<center></h2>
  <p><center>One thing I enjoy doing for fun is art. I love exploring different mediums of art, like watercolor and acrylic. Types of art that I have done include acrylic and watercolor painting, texture painting, shading, modeling with clay, figure drawing, pencil sketching, etc. Doing art allows me to calm down, and acts like a stress buster for me. <center></p>
    <h2><center>-HANGING OUT WITH FRIENDS-<center></h2>
<p><center>In my spare time, I often go outside to hang out with my friends. It's quite convenient to socialize with them, as all four of my close friends live in the same neighbourhood as me. Outside, me and my friends usually play things like volleyball, badminton, sometimes soccer, and so on. Sometimes, when it's too cold outside or rainy, we just stay inside and play a board game or sometimes even watch a movie!<center></p>
