<h2><center>-ART-<center></h2>
  <p><center>One thing I enjoy doing for fun is art. I love exploring different mediums of art, like watercolor and acrylic. Types of art that I have done include acrylic and watercolor painting, texture painting, shading, modeling with clay, figure drawing, pencil sketching, etc. Doing art allows me to calm down, and acts like a stress buster for me. <center></p>
