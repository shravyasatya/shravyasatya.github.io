        <h2><center>Family is one of life's most precious gifts. I greatly appreciate my family, and never in a million years would I trade them for anything. My family consists of 4 people, my mom, my dad, my brother, and me. I have a really good relationship with my mom and dad, and my brother, even though my brother and I argue a lot about the smallest things. To the right is a picture of my family and me at my cousins' house with their dog, Oscar.<center></h2>
