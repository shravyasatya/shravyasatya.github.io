    <h1><center>-FAVORITES-<center></h1>
      <h2><center>-SPORTS-<center></h2>
      <p><center>My favorite sport to play is tennis. I've been playing for quite a few years (8 years or so), and I really enjoy playing it. I've played multiple matches throughout 2021-2023, and have had losses but also many wins. Although I play tennis, my favorite sport to watch would be basketball. Of course, I love watching tennis too, and watching it allows me to pick up many concepts, but I find basketball a bit more entertaining to watch. I also enjoy watching the FIFA World Cup when it's going on. <center></p>

        <h2><center>-TV SHOWS-<center></h2>
    <p><center>My favorite TV show is Stranger Things. I really enjoy the mix of horror, thriller, a bit of comedy and romance, and fantasy. I find it extremely interesting and I would rewatch it 2,000 times. My favorite character is Max, because in my opinion she's a baddie. A classic show that I love watching just for laughs is Tom and Jerry. I've been watching it since I was little, (I think everybody my age has), and I still haven't outgrown it. :) <center></p>

      <h2><center>-BOOKS-<center></h2>
      <p><center>My favorite book is "The Summer I Turned Pretty" by Jenny Han. It's a three book series and I love all three of the books. It's young adult fiction and romance and is very very interesting. I usually don't spend a lot of my time reading books, but when I was reading The Summer I Turned Pretty series, reading was all I was doing. I also usually don't get emotional to books. but this series actually made me cry. The book series also has a TV series on Prime that I haven't watched yet. I'm definitely looking forward to watching that and it will go in my TV show favorites list. <center></p>
