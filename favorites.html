      <h3><center>My favorite sport to play is tennis. I've been playing for quite a few years (8 years or so), and I really enjoy playing it. I've played multiple matches throughout 2021-2023, and have had losses but also many wins. Although I play tennis, my favorite sport to watch would be basketball. Of course, I love watching tennis too, and watching it allows me to pick up many concepts, but I find basketball a bit more entertaining to watch. I also enjoy watching the FIFA World Cup when it's going on. <center><h1>
